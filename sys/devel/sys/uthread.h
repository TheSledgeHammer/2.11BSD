 * User threads work slightly different than other threads in 2.11BSD.
 * User threads have two points of access into kernel space. 1) kernel threads and 2) User.
 * Both these serve different purposes. Kernel Threads is purely for ipc & runtime control/instructions of jobs & tasks.
 * While the user is for when a user thread/fibre needs direct access to kernelspace (i.e. drivers, io etc).
