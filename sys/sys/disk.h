/*
 * Disk device structures.  Rather than replicate driver specific variations
 * of the following in each driver it was made common here.
 *
 * Some of the flags are specific to various drivers. For example ALIVE and 
 * ONLINE apply to MSCP devices more than to SMD devices while the SEEK flag
 * applies to the SMD (xp) driver but not to the MSCP driver.  The rest
 * of the flags as well as the open partition bitmaps are usable by any disk
 * driver.  One 'dkdevice' structure is needed for each disk drive supported
 * by a driver.
 *
 * The entire disklabel is not resident in the kernel address space.  Only
 * the partition table is directly accessible by the kernel.  The MSCP driver
 * does not care (or know) about the geometry of the disk.  Not holding
 * the entire label in the kernel saved quite a bit of D space.  Other drivers
 * which need geometry information from the label will have to map in the
 * label and copy out the geometry data they require.  This is unlikely to
 * cause much overhead since labels are read and written infrequently - when
 * mounting a drive, assigning a label, running newfs, etc.
